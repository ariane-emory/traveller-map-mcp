## Project Description 

Our goal is to create an MCP server for the Traveller Map (https://travellermap.com) in TypeScript that can be used to access its API.

### TravellerMap API reference:

Documentation for the TravellerMap API can be found at https://travellermap.com/doc/api. You can use your WebFetch tool to access it.

## Code Style Guidelines

Adherence to existing code patterns in `game.js`, `style.css`, and `index.html` is paramount.

- **General**:
    - Prioritize readability and simplicity.
    - Keep functions concise and focused on a single responsibility.
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**:
    - **Naming Conventions**:
        - Variables and functions: `snake_case ` (e.g., `player_health`, `update_game_area`). Using camelCase for the names of functions or variables is NOT permitted (other than for built in/library-provided variables/functions, since we aren't the one picking those names).
        - Constants: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `TILE_SIZE`).
        - This naming convention is a MUST, you may NOT use camelCase names when defining functions/variables.
        - Seriously, DON'T FUCKING USE CAMELCASE OR YOU WILL BE FIRED!
    - **Imports**: No module imports; all scripts are assumed to run in the global scope via `<script>` tags in `index.html`.
    - **Formatting**:
        - Use 2 spaces for indentation.
        - Place opening curly braces on the same line as the statement (`if (condition) {`).
        - Use semicolons at the end of statements.
    - **Comments**: Add comments sparingly, focusing on _why_ complex logic exists rather than _what_ it does.
    - **Curly Braces on if/elses**:
        - If both branches of an if/else contain only a single statement and the curly braces could be omitted, do so. If either branch has multiple statments (and thus requires curly braces), use curly braces on both branches.
          When curly braces are not used, the branch must still be on a separate line.
          Good examples:
          // curly braces not required since there's only one statment in the 'then' branch.
          if (foo) 
            bar(); 
          // curly braces not required since there's only one statment in each branch:
          if (foo) 
            bar(); 
          else
            baz(); 
          // curly braces required since 'else' branch contains multipe statements:
          if (foo) { 
            bar(); 
          } else {
            baz(); 
            quux(); 
          }
          Bad examples:
          // inconsistent, 'else' branch requires curly braces but 'then' branch omits them:
          if (foo) 
            bar(); 
          else { 
            baz(); 
            quux(); 
          } 
          // bad, 'then' branch should be on a separate line:
          if (foo) 
            bar(); 
        - If a while loop's body contains only a single statement and the curly braces could be omitted, do so.
